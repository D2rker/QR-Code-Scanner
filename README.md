# QR_scanner

A new Flutter project of QR code scanner.

## Getting Started

 QR code (Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) invented in 1994 by the Japanese company Denso Wave.

           How QR Codes Work?
 
 1. Scanning - A QR code scanner uses a camera to capture the image of the QR code
 2. Decoding - It identifies the three large squares to determine the orientation and then uses the smaller alignment and timing patterns to understand the layout and size of the code.
 3. Error correction - include error correction capabilities. This means that even if a part of the QR code is damaged or dirty, the scanner can still accurately decode the information.
 4. Data Extraction - The encoded data is then extracted and converted into a human-readable format, such as a URL, text, or other information.
